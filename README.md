This system is a basic fire activated alarm. It is built around an Arduino Microcontroller. It is connected to a Flame Sensor, a buzzer, a Relay Module, a resistor, and a GSM Module. Once you have the code, you can connect all the external parts. The easiest way to do this is with a breadboard. This will let you make temporary connections to test everything out. Later, the connections can be made permanent using a PCB. This project contains the code and the connection guide to help create the system. It makes the use of following major components:

  1. Arduino UNO R3
  2. Flame Sensor
  3. GSM SIM 900A Module
  4. Relay Module
  5. Piezo Buzzer
  6. LEDs
  7. Connecting Wires
  8. Breadboard/PCB
  9. 5V Battery
  10. Arduino IDE

The main functionalities that this system provides is: 
 1. Fire Detection Via sensor
 2. User alerts through call and sms with the help of GSM Module
 3. Auto power Cut-off using Relay Module
 4. Audio-Visual Alerts to the neighbours by making the use of LEDs and buzzer.
